# Splitting Postman collection into directories - a better storage format

Postman collections are created using the Postman UI application. These
collections are represented as a [JSON
file](https://learning.postman.com/collection-format/getting-started/structure-of-a-collection/)
by the Postman UI application.  It is a single file that contains all the
requests/tests/variables etc of the collection.  It is designed to be edited
within the Postman UI. The `newman` tool allows teams to run Postman collections
as part of their CI pipelines by supplying the Postman collection file as an
argument. Typically, teams that rely on Postman for their API testing in CI
pipelines maintain a copy of the collection file in their source repository.
When teams maintain the Postman collection in their repository, they will have
the following workflow to make changes to it and push is upstream:

* Import the collection json file from the repo into Postman UI
* Make changes to the collection in Postman UI
* Export the collection to a file using Postman UI
* Commit and push the changes

There are a few challenges with the above workflow:

1. Collection file diffs are very hard to review in pull requests
    * Old format collection diff: https://github.com/juspay/hyperswitch/commit/7e29adb5c9dee8b03ef58ccbd85b07b106459380

    * New format collection diff: https://github.com/juspay/hyperswitch/pull/2117/files

1. Developers cannot use their favourite editor to make changes, add/remove new tests

As a consequence of the above, collection maintenance suffers and often become stale.

## Solution to the above challenges

The core reason for challenges presented above is the file format in which the
Postman requests are maintained.  A single JSON file that encapsulates the entire
request code and sequencing does not lend itself for easy reviewing and be an
all-editor friendly format.

This fork of newman attempts to address the challenge by representing the
Postman collection as a set of directories/files.  It allows developers to
create Postman collection using the directory representation and also run them.
It achieves this by re-constructing the collection json from the directory/file
structure and leveraging the existing newman `run` implementation.

For example, this is the [directory equivalent
representation](examples/Sample%20Postman%20Collection) of a [sample
collection](examples/sample-collection.json) in the examples directory as
generated by the `dir-export` command.

### Directory representation of collection

The following is a tree structure of the directory that represents the Postman
collection with annotations of what each file corresponds to in a Postman
collection.
```
examples/Sample Postman Collection
├── .info.json                # contains the info element from the top of collection json
├── .meta.json                # contains the ordering of the request folders
├── .auth.json                # contains the auth element from the top of the collection json
├── .variable.json            # contains the variable element from the top of the collection json
├── .event.json               # contains the event element from the top of the collection json
└── A simple GET request
    ├── .event.meta.json      # contains the ordering of the scripts - prerequest / test
    ├── event.test.js         # the test script that runs post the request
    ├── event.prerequest.js   # the test script that runs before the request
    ├── request.json          # the request json from the Postman collection
    └── response.json         # the response json
```

### Next steps
This concept of representing Postman collections as a directory opens up programmatic
pre-processing of request data before running the requests.  This could include things like the following:

* Re-using same data across requests
* Using other javascript libraries in testing code

The instructions for using the tool are given below.  Please give it spin and let me know it you if it is useful.

## Usage

### Installing newman from this fork

One can install the newman executable in this fork using the command:

```
npm install -g 'git+ssh://git@github.com:knutties/newman.git#feature/newman-dir'
```

The following no-arg run shows the new commands added to newman to help manage Postman
requests maintained as directories/files instead of a single json file.

```
$ newman

Usage: newman [options] [command]

Options:
  -v, --version                                               output the version number
  -h, --help                                                  display help for command

Commands:
  dir-add-folder [options] <folder-path>                      Add a folder to directory based Postman collection in the given path
  dir-add-request [options] <request-path>                    Add a request to directory based Postman collection in the given path
  dir-collection-create [options] <collection-path>           Create a directory based Postman collection in the given path
  dir-export [options] <postman-collection-file>              Convert a Postman collection file into its directory representation
  dir-export-import-check [options] <postman-collection-file> Check if an export followed by import results in same collection
  dir-import [options] <collection-dir>                       Convert a Postman directory representation into a postman collection
  dir-remove-folder <folder-path>                             Remove folder at given path from directory based Postman collection
  dir-remove-request <request-path>                           Remove request at given path from directory based Postman collection
  dir-run [options] <collection-dir>                          Runs the requests in collection-dir, with all the provided options
  run [options] <collection>                                  Initiate a Postman Collection run from a given URL or path

    To get available options for a command:
      newman <command> -h
```

The following sections show the invocation of the different commands added in
this fork of newman.

### Create a new directory based Postman collection
```
newman dir-collection-create new-dir-collection
```

### Generating directory representation for an existing collection
```
newman dir-export examples/sample-collection.json
```

### Convert a directory representation back to a Postman collection json file
```
newman dir-import examples/Sample\ Postman\ Collection/ -o examples/sample-collection.json
```

### Diff the collection generated by export followed by its import
This command is typically used to test the tool itself to ensure it can handle
all collection json use-cases.
```
newman dir-export-import-check examples/sample-collection.json
```

### Execute a Postman collection stored in the directory format
```
newman dir-run examples/Sample\ Postman\ Collection/
```
The `dir-run` command supports all the options that the stock `run` command of
newman supports.  This is achieved by re-using the same set of command options
for both the commands.

Sample output of `dir-run` shown below
```
newman

### Add a folder under a existing directory
```
newman dir-add-folder examples/Sample\ Postman\ Collection/folder1
```


### Add a request under a directory
```
newman dir-add-request examples/Sample\ Postman\ Collection/test4
```

This command adds the request to the end of the requests already present in the
folder.  The order of the requests is stored in a separate file called
[.meta.json](examples/Sample%20Postman%20Collection/.meta.json).  The order of requests
can be changed by re-ordering the requests in this file.

### Remove a folder
```
newman dir-remove-folder examples/Sample\ Postman\ Collection/folder1
```

### Remove a request
```
newman dir-remove-request examples/Sample\ Postman\ Collection/test4
```
